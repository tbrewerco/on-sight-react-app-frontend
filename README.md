# On.Sight Climber's App

On.Sight is a climbing gym application that features a public-facing (PF) version for climbing gym users and an operator-facing (OF) version for gym operators. 

The PF version will allow climbing gym users to do the following:

- Search for their favorite climbing gyms
- Rate the difficulty and quality of climbing routes 
- Share comments, beta, and pictures relating to the route
  
The OF version allows climbing gym operators to do the following:

- Post Gym details and climbing routes to a database. 
- Manage gym operations (inventory, payroll, scheduling, income, expenses, etc.)
